cd /usr/local/src/
wget http://www.noip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
tar xf noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
cd noip-2.1.9-1/
make install

You will then be prompted to log in with your No-IP account username and password.

If you get “make not found” or “missing gcc” then you do not have the gcc compiler tools on your machine. You will need to install these in order to proceed.

To Configure the Client

As root again (or with sudo) issue the below command:

/usr/local/bin/noip2 -C (dash capital C, this will create the default config file)
You will then be prompted for your No-IP username and password, as well as the hostnames you wish to update. Be careful, one of the questions is “Do you wish to update ALL hosts.” If answered incorrectly, this could effect hostnames in your account that are pointing at other locations.

Now that the client is installed and configured, you just need to launch it. Simply issue this final command to launch the client in the background:

/usr/local/bin/noip2
Read the README file in the no-ip-2.1.9 folder for instructions on how to make the client run at startup. This varies depending on what Linux distribution you are running. Typically, to run the client at startup you will use:

$ systemctl enable noip2.service (start on boot)

The other common commands used for Ubuntu are:

$ systemctl start noip2.service (start immediately)

$ systemctl status noip2.service (for status)

The DUC should now be installed on Ubuntu
