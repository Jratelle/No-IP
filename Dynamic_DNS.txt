Here is how I understand dynamin DNS services. 
like a VPN you use a connection to a server at first through your ISP but then instead of you using the new public ip address that the VPN gives you you will 
have a public facing DNS outside of your network that you are in that people can go to. People will connect to the DNS server that you register with and then 
that server will find your DNS location that the person is trying to get to and then then will be redirected to your server.
